# Password Reset System - GradePro

## 🔐 Overview

GradePro now includes a comprehensive password reset system that allows users to securely reset their passwords via email verification. This system follows security best practices and provides a smooth user experience.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Security Features
- **Secure Token Generation**: Uses crypto.randomBytes for cryptographically secure tokens
- **Token Hashing**: Tokens are hashed before storage in the database
- **Time-Limited Tokens**: Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- **Single-Use Tokens**: Tokens are invalidated after successful password reset
- **No User Enumeration**: System doesn't reveal if an email exists in the database

### 📧 Email Integration
- **HTML Email Templates**: Beautiful, responsive email templates
- **Plain Text Fallback**: Text versions for email clients that don't support HTML
- **Development Mode**: Email content is logged to console during development
- **Production Ready**: Easy to integrate with email services like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, responsive interface for all password reset steps
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback at each step of the process
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Forgot Password Request
```
User enters email → System generates secure token → Email sent with reset link
```

### 2. Token Verification
```
User clicks link → System verifies token validity → Redirects to reset form
```

### 3. Password Reset
```
User enters new password → System validates and updates → Success confirmation
```

## 📱 User Interface

### Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`)
- Email input field with validation
- Clear instructions and help text
- Success state with next steps
- Link back to login page

### Reset Password Page (`/reset-password/:token`)
- Token verification on page load
- New password input with strength indicator
- Password confirmation field
- Security notices and tips

### Login Page Integration
- "Forgot your password?" link added to login form
- Seamless navigation between login and password reset

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Routes

#### POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`
```javascript
// Request body
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password reset link has been sent to your email address."
}
```

#### GET `/api/auth/verify-reset-token/:token`
```javascript
// Response (valid token)
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reset token is valid"
}

// Response (invalid token)
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid or expired reset token"
}
```

#### POST `/api/auth/reset-password/:token`
```javascript
// Request body
{
  "password": "newSecurePassword123"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password has been reset successfully."
}
```

### Database Schema Updates

Added to User model:
```javascript
passwordResetToken: {
  type: String,
  select: false  // Hidden from queries by default
},
passwordResetExpires: {
  type: Date,
  select: false  // Hidden from queries by default
}
```

### Email Service

Located in `server/utils/emailService.js`:
- `sendPasswordResetEmail(email, resetUrl)` - Sends password reset email
- `sendWelcomeEmail(email, name)` - Sends welcome email for new users
- HTML and text template generation
- Development and production modes

## 🧪 Testing

### Development Testing
1. Visit `/test-password-reset` for a testing interface
2. Enter a registered user's email
3. Check server console for reset URL
4. Use the URL to test the complete flow

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Test Forgot Password**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Click "Forgot your password?"
   - Enter valid email address
   - Check for success message

2. **Test Invalid Email**:
   - Enter non-existent email
   - Should still show success (security feature)

3. **Test Reset Token**:
   - Use reset URL from server console
   - Should load reset password form
   - Try invalid/expired token

4. **Test Password Reset**:
   - Enter new password
   - Confirm password matches
   - Submit and verify success
   - Try logging in with new password

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Token Security
- Tokens are 32-byte random values (256-bit entropy)
- Stored as SHA-256 hashes in database
- Never stored in plain text
- Automatically expire after 1 hour

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing rate limiting for forgot password requests
- Prevent abuse by limiting requests per IP/email

### Email Security
- Reset links are single-use only
- Links expire quickly (1 hour)
- No sensitive information in email content
- Clear security warnings in emails

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Email Service Setup
1. Choose an email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES)
2. Update `server/utils/emailService.js` with actual email sending
3. Set environment variables for email credentials
4. Test email delivery in staging environment

### Environment Variables
```env
# Email Service (example for SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@gradepro.com
FROM_NAME=GradePro Support

# Client URL for reset links
CLIENT_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Example SendGrid Integration
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const sendPasswordResetEmail = async (email, resetUrl) => {
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: {
      email: process.env.FROM_EMAIL,
      name: process.env.FROM_NAME
    },
    subject: 'GradePro - Password Reset Request',
    html: generatePasswordResetHTML(resetUrl),
    text: generatePasswordResetText(resetUrl)
  };

  await sgMail.send(msg);
};
```
